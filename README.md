Yelpic is an app for browsing pictures of businesses around you on Yelp.

### How do I get set up? ###

Before use, register for the Yelp API [here](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3). 

Once you have your client\_id and client\_secret, open Config.plist, and enter those values in the appropriate places.
